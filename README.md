# 🛍️ E-Commerce Funnel & Conversion Analysis

This project simulates a real-world analytics scenario: tracking the **user journey from product view to purchase** using event and order data.

It’s inspired by my experience with **advertising and product performance at Amazon**, and was built to demonstrate analytical thinking, data engineering steps, and visual storytelling using Python.
